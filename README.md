# Server Monitor Bot

Basically this is a tool I developed to keep an eye on my server when I might not have access to a PC or access the console.
I have the program runing on the server. And it is linked to a bot on your telegram via the bot auth token. I could run commands 
like 'ps aux' to see if all the process is running. So basically any command you could run on the the linux machine you could 
run wit this bot. Just to be safe you can configure the list of commands that can be run from this.
